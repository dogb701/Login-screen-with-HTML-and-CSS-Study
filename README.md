# Login-screen-with-HTML-and-CSS-Study
Studying how to make a login screen with HTML and css

I'm trying to do a screen of login with a video of youtube. I would like to know if someone 
could give me more tips to learn more of html and css. I ask you to put how I could do that with 
others ways and in a way easier. 
Thank you to learn :D

I'm from Brazil and I have a dream...
